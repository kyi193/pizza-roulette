# Pizza Roulette 🍕🍕🍕
Sometime's it's really tough to choose a pizza restaurant because of the sheer amount that exists. 
Pizza Roulette aims to fix this by first randomly selecting 20 of the top pizza restaurants in your location. 

Then, the app will randomly select eight from the list of top 20 and place it on a spinner wheel and choose a restaurant for you. 
Pizza Roulette relieves the stress of second guessing yourself and lets you carry on with your day and focus on what's really import: eating pizza.

# Hang tight, Pizza Roulette is still in development.
